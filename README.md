# 🚀 Multicloud Build Action (Composite) — *Open Source* & Stable `@v1`

Build and optionally push Docker images to **AWS ECR** and/or **Azure ACR** from a single action.  
Optimized for **self-hosted AKS/EKS** runners (with a BuildKit sidecar) and works on **GitHub-hosted** runners too.  
Uses **Buildx Bake** for parallel multi-image builds and reads default registries from inputs.

🧩 **Open Source:** Maintained by **Affinity7 Consulting Ltd**, this action is part of the [**GitOps Manager**](https://gitopsmanager.io) open-source toolchain — powering both community and enterprise automation for multi-cloud Kubernetes environments.

> **Official Release:** This marks the first stable release under the new versioning policy (see below).  
> **Stable:** Pin to `@v1`. Immutable releases (e.g., `v1.0.0`) are also available.

## 🌐 GitOps Manager™ Enterprise Platform

[**GitOps Manager Enterprise**](https://gitopsmanager.io) is the full platform that powers this open-source action.  
It’s a **turnkey GitOps automation platform** for AWS and Azure — combining open-source GitHub Actions, Kubernetes infrastructure automation, and global-scale CI/CD.

**Highlights:**
- Secure, opinionated **multi-cloud GitOps automation** for Kubernetes workloads.  
- Deep integration with **ArgoCD**, **Argo Workflows**, **Traefik**, **ECK**, and **Kubernetes Dashboard**.  
- Built for **high availability**, **autoscaling**, and **managed upgrades**.  
- Supports **Workload Identity**, **Pod Identity**, and **private, network-isolated clusters**.  
- Enables **global deployments**, **secret management**, and **production-grade infrastructure** with **zero vendor lock-in**.

## ✅ Highlights - Multicloud Build Action

- 🐳 **Build once** and **push** to **AWS**, **Azure**, **both**, or **build-only**.  
- 🧺 **Buildx Bake**: parallel multi-image builds from either:
  - a single `{ image, build_file, path }` triple, or
  - a **JSON array** of `{ context, build_file, image_name }`.  
- 🧠 **Smart cache**: BuildKit cache targeted to **the cloud the runner is on** (via `detect-cloud`), with sensible fallback on GitHub-hosted runners.   
- 🧰 **ECR ensure**: auto-creates the ECR repository on first push if missing.

## 🔑 Required permissions

No additional permissions are required for the credential sources that come from
the runner itself (Pod Identity, Workload Identity, MSI, static keys). This
action works with the default `contents: read` that GitHub gives every job.

**GitHub OIDC is the exception.** If you set `aws_ecr_oidc_role_arn` or
`azure_acr_oidc_client_id`, the calling workflow must grant the token — a
composite action cannot grant it for itself:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
```

Without it the action fails and says so, rather than quietly falling back to a
stored key.

### Where to put it

On the job that runs the action, so the rest of the workflow keeps the
repository default. Declaring `permissions:` makes it **exhaustive** — every
scope you do not list becomes `none` — so a workflow-level block can silently
revoke what another job was relying on:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: gitopsmanager/multicloud-build-action@v1
        with:
          push: both
          image: team/svc-a
          aws_registry:             ${{ vars.AWS_ECR_REGISTRY }}
          aws_ecr_oidc_role_arn:    ${{ vars.AWS_ECR_OIDC_ROLE_ARN }}
          azure_registry:           ${{ vars.AZURE_ACR_REGISTRY }}
          azure_acr_oidc_client_id: ${{ vars.AZURE_ACR_OIDC_CLIENT_ID }}
          azure_acr_oidc_tenant_id: ${{ vars.AZURE_ACR_OIDC_TENANT_ID }}
```

**If this action runs inside a reusable workflow, the grant must come from the
workflow that CALLS it.** Permissions only ever narrow down a chain: a called
workflow cannot give itself a scope the caller withheld, so adding the block to
the inner job alone leaves `id-token` at `none`.

```yaml
# the TOP-level workflow
jobs:
  build:
    uses: my-org/shared-actions/.github/workflows/docker-build.yaml@v1
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
```

None of these values are secret — a role ARN and a client id are useless without
the trust relationship — so they belong in organisation **variables**, not
secrets.

> - For most users, pinning to the **major tag** (e.g., `@v3`) is a good balance of stability + updates.  
> - For **strict reproducibility**, pin by **commit SHA** (e.g., `docker/bake-action@<sha>`).

## 📊 Collection of Usage Metrics

To understand adoption and improve our open-source tooling, **GitOps Manager** collects minimal, anonymized usage data from automated GitHub Actions that use our workflows and integrations.

### What We Collect
Each participating GitHub Action sends a small JSON payload containing:
- **Action Type** – `"build"` or `"deploy"`
- **GitHub Organization** and **Repository** (securely hashed for anonymity)
- **Timestamp** of the event

Example payload (after hashing):
```json
{
  "action": "build",
  "org": "11a6114071b1...",
  "repo": "3ad2023afd63...",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T19:04:18Z"
}
```

## 🔐 Auth (automatic selection)

- **Azure (ACR):** **GitHub OIDC** → AKS **Workload Identity** → node **MSI** (UAMI/SAI via IMDS) → **client secret** fallback.  
- **AWS (ECR):** **GitHub OIDC** → **Pod Identity** (EKS) → **node role** (IMDS) → **static access keys** fallback.

GitHub OIDC is only attempted when you name an identity for that cloud, and then
it is the **only** method tried: naming a role or client id says which identity
to use, so falling back to a different one would defeat the point of configuring
it. Set neither and the chains behave exactly as they always have.

Because the token comes from GitHub rather than from the cloud the runner sits
in, the same identity works **from anywhere** — an EKS pod pushing to ACR, an AKS
pod pushing to ECR, or a GitHub-hosted runner with no cloud identity at all. It
is also the only option here that stores no key and no secret.

> ⚠️ **Token Expiry Notice**  
> Credentials obtained from Pod Identity, Node MSI/IMDS, or other metadata sources typically **expire after about one hour**.  
> If your builds may run longer, break them into smaller Bake targets or sequential jobs to avoid mid-build authentication failures.

> On **GitHub-hosted** runners, use GitHub OIDC — it needs no stored credential.
> Azure client secret and AWS access keys remain supported for installations that
> have not set up federated identity yet.

## 🛠 What the action does

1. **Detects cloud** (`azure` / `aws` / `unknown`) using `gitopsmanager/detect-cloud@v1`.  
2. **Normalizes inputs** (single image or array) → generates `docker-bake.json`.  
3. **Provider-aware cache**: chooses exactly **one** registry for cache (`cache-to` / `cache-from`).  
4. **Logs into registries**:
   - **ACR:** REST flow (no `az`) with WI/MSI/secret.
   - **ECR:** Ensures repo exists (SigV4) and logs in (identity or keys).
5. **Runs Buildx Bake** with `source: .` and pushes if requested.

## 🔢 Versioning Policy — Official Release

Starting with this release, all future versions follow the new **stable semantic tagging policy**.

Previously, tags like `v1`, `v1.4`, and `v1.4.7` might have moved unpredictably.  
From now on, they will always follow these simple, reliable rules:

| Tag | Moves When | Purpose |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **`v1`** | Any new release in the `v1.x.x` series | Always points to the latest stable release in the major version line. |
| **`v1.4`** | A new patch in the same minor version (e.g. `v1.4.7 → v1.4.8`) | Stays within that feature line. Receives only bug fixes and optimizations — no breaking changes. |
| **`v1.4.7`** | Never | Fully immutable and reproducible. |

### How to choose
- **`@v1`** → Always up to date with the newest non-breaking changes.  
- **`@v1.4`** → Stable feature line with fixes only.  
- **`@v1.4.7`** → Frozen snapshot for exact reproducibility.

All tags will now **increment forward permanently** — no re-use or re-tagging of old versions.  
This marks the **official release** of the action under the **Affinity7 Consulting** stable versioning model.
